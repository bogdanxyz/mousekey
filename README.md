# mousekey
This is a program which will transform your keyboard into a mouse!
With this program, you can increase efficency, and not take hands of keyboard,
You can edit code, or use it as it is, while holding right alt and using keys J, K, L, I, as mouse cursor and keys U and O as left and right button.
This program is really functional because there are no keybinds with right alt and these keys!

Enjoy.ðŸ˜‰

Small Warning,
If you want to open links on web, you should first right click it (using right alt + o) and then open the m in new tab  (right alt + u),
my reccomendation ðŸ˜Ž
